=== TODO

setup sbt build... Scala 10 scalaz 7 specs2 scalacheck java 7??

implement a very small Free language to help me get how it works

implement an interpretor for the free Lang that edits a byte array

think about project structure and supporting tools and layout

create case classes for Java class file parts

create a Reader for class Class => AST that places values in AST(or something else with more knwledge, does Free allow for this?)
create a Writer from AST => Class  is this the forgetful functor to the Free??

bash out some example usages of scam lang, should be a nice DSL for classworking, simple but not too simple

really start to think about the lang, primatives, combinators semantics etc

really understand how the JVM verifier works!

create Free lang verbs for scam lang

start on interpretor - first one, change field value (but not type)
second one add new field
remove field (must remove refs to it too, does that mean make methods return null
   or better can I make it a compile time error in SCAM ie the combinator types will enforce correct "operations"?
   will I need Macros for this??
change field type (needs to find all refs to it and fix them up too)
etc

create other interpretors to do :-
   other versions of JVM bytecode (maybe do this last?? but think about it up front)
   simple scan of class and spit out bytecode
   simple scan of class with a filter to just show bytecode for parts of interest
   whatever else seems awesome.

performance test against other bytecoders

fun and profit?
